# Introduction

## Study 1: College Transition Study (CTS)

### Materials and Methods

All study procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. The study was open to all incoming undergraduate students, including students in their first ever semester at any higher education institution (*first-years*) and transfer students in their first semester at the university (*transfers*). We sent emails advertising the study through university-approved e-mail lists and posted flyers in popular locations on campus. Due to limited resources, we closed recruitment once 41 first-years and 41 transfers provided consent to participate ($N=82$). In total, participants completed eight web-based assessments, two during each month of the fall semester (September-December 2008). Participants could earn up to \$35 for participation: \$7 for each month in which they completed both assessments and a bonus of \$7 for completing all eight assessments. Three participants (4%) dropped from the study before the final assessment. The participation rate for each study assessment exceeded 90%. Demographic characteristics of study participants are summarized in Table 1.
